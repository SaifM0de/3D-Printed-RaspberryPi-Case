# RaspberryPi-Case
## STL, 3MF, and GCODE files for 3D printed RaspberryPi Case

Printed with 1.75mm PETG using the CREALITY CR6-SE and the following basic settings:

* Layer Height: 0.3mm
* Print Speed: 45mm/s
* Z-Offset: 0.25mm
* Infill: 100%
* Printing Temp: 230C
* Bed Temp: 80C
* Cooling: 20% Fan Speed
* Support: >=30 degree overhangs
* Adhesion: Brim

PLA will also work but should be avoided since its glass transition temperature is around 50C so will likely warp over time when CPU temps exceed 50C
